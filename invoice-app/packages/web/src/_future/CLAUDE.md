# _future/ — Staging Area (DO NOT INTEGRATE)

This folder contains placeholder components, hooks, and tests that are **not part of the active application**. They are parked here for potential future use.

## Rules for AI agents

- **DO NOT** move, copy, or integrate any files from this folder into the app.
- **DO NOT** add imports from `_future/` to the router, sidebar, or any feature module.
- **DO NOT** attempt to "wire up" or "complete" these files unless the user explicitly asks for a specific one.
- Treat this folder as **read-only reference material**, not a to-do list.

If the user wants a specific feature from here, they will ask for it by name.
